## Gameplay patch for Pro Evolution Soccer 2019's VGL branch

Pricketti is the gameplay patch developed for the [/vg/League](https://implyingrigged.info/wiki//vg/_League) for its use in PES2019. This is achieved like the previous PES2021 patch by changing the binary constants file Konami left in the game's data packs. Its name is a portmanteu of the other patch's name and player #19 of the last /vg/L winner, /hgg2d/. Only the modified objects are included in the repository.

**Current patch notes:**
- Disabled all slow downs
- Enabled all [subConcepts](https://implyingrigged.info/wiki/User:MarcoZ/dt18_Files_Breakdown#Team)
- Tweaked the GK to aid 1v1 conversion rate, punch & catch rates
- Spiked up first time chances (headers, volleys, etc.)
- Lowered stamina loss
